# Java-Tops-Travel ✈️

Tops Travel is a small program in Java which allows members to login to a website class and then book a holiday.

If a discount is available for a member, it is applied accordingly.

Some basic validation is used inside of the program to ensure members cannot book holidays without logging in.

A summary of each file:
* [Member.java](https://github.com/SHussain84/Java-Tops-Travel/blob/main/Member.java) is the class which contains the constructor for a member. It also contains the relevant accessors, mutators and other methods to allow a member to use the system.
* [Website.java](https://github.com/SHussain84/Java-Tops-Travel/blob/main/Website.java) imitates an actual website, allowing members to login and logout by passing a Member object to its methods. It contains the constructor for a Website object, along with the accessor and mutator methods for each field.
* [Holiday.java](https://github.com/SHussain84/Java-Tops-Travel/blob/main/Holiday.java) contains the constructor for a Holiday object, along with the accessor and mutator methods for its fields.
